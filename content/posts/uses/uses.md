Inspired by many others I listed the software tools that I use, and also how I use them.

### Editor
I use Microsoft’s [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the coding. What I mostly love about it is the “Remote Containers” extension. Since I’m mostly working with docker, and I am also switching a lot between projects, I like to open each project in my editor and have all the docker containers started.

### Database
For database management, I am using [TablePlus](h). Very important for me are the security modes, since I toggle a lot between production, stage, and local databases. These modes already saved me a few times from accidentally running queries on the wrong environment. 

### Git
I’m only using *git* on the command line without any visual tools. Most UI tools for git always feel slow for me. I have two favorite commands aliased.

## HTTP
Since I am working daily with REST APIs, I use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for testing my requests. Quite often I find myself copying AJAX requests as CURL from devtools and pasting it to Insomnia for debugging. 

### Notes
For note-taking and also generally for my writing I am using [Bear](https://bear.app/). It’s an elegant tool for writing without distractions.

### Terminal
As a terminal fan, I am using [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as a dropdown terminal combined with [tmux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/tmux), which allows me to split my terminal windows. It’s very handy if you are observing logs from different applications.  

### TODOs
[Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) is my to-do application; there I am writing anything that comes to my mind, which I want to remember. During a coding session, I may remember that I want to refactor a function or write a test for a class. By pressing `opt + .`  the “Quick entry” appears; there I can quickly write my thought and return to whatever I was doing.
