I was building a daily I product which I had no idea what it should look like at the end. But I kept going and I learned a lesson.

In 2019 I wanted to make an Elasticsearch library for PHP. Even though there were already some of them, none of the existing libraries covered￼ what I was expecting. With some interaction that I had with Elasticsearch, I was amazed. All the tools for building a search experience in one, and Open Source.

I started building it, and soon enough I needed a server. For this,  I wrote a script that creates an Elasticsearch server.  After I created a UI  and then I added more stuff, and more stuff. I started adding functions like subscription and authentication, but I had no idea about what I was building. 

I had a lot of ideas, that came from podcasts and other applications I was using, but how could I combine all of them into one product.

And for 2 years this question remained unanswered for me, while I was continuously building and creating stuff, which I thought was useful. 

Finally, before 3 weeks, it became clear,  from this point it’s just a matter of time until I can launch it and tell people about it.

I am writing this to share my experience and to point that it’s important to get started without having the full plan. Don’t wait until you are ready, just start. And at some point, everything will become clear.

For me, it took 2 years…
